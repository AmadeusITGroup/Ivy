IV ("ivy") is a lightweight template engine mixing concepts from ReactJS and Angular2.

To install the source code and run the unit tests, first install gulp and then simply run:

```sh
    npm install -g http-server

    npm install
    gulp build
    http-server

    >> go to http://localhost:8080/dist/
```
