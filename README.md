IV ("ivy") is a lightweight JS template engine mixing concepts from ReactJS, Angular2 and Incremental DOM.

To install the source code and run the unit tests, first install yarn and then simply run:

```sh
    yarn install

    yarn run test
```

PS: once compiled, tests can also be run and debugged in visual studio code.
