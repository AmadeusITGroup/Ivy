# Simple
    - Relies on JavaScript: no specific or convoluted syntax to support control statements, loops, expressions, import/export or local variables
    - No implicit behaviors: each element of syntax can be mapped to a single behaviors - no need to learn exceptions
    - Explicit: every unconventional behavior is always associated to a symbol or a prefix (e.g. "*", ".", "@" or "$") in order to be able to easily look-up for information.
    - Easy debug
    - Highly composable syntax: what is learned in one context can be used in another context (e.g. parameters, decorators, etc.)
    - Simple components as functions, rich components with optional controller classes
    - Component API is easily and clearly expressed

# Rich semantics
    - Templates
    - Components
    - Decorators
    - Container components
    - Container components with multiple, hierarchical contents

# Typescript-native
    - Designed for typescript
    - Fully typed APIs (components and decorators)

# Efficient
    - Deferred component content
    - Version tracking / "on push"
    - Async (todo)
    - Error messages

# Reactive
